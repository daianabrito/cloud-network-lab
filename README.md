# Cloud Networking Lab (Local)

This repository contains a local cloud networking lab designed to help understand core networking concepts used in real-world cloud environments.

## Objectives

- Understand how applications communicate via DNS  
- Practice subnet separation (app, db, ingress)  
- Analyze firewall rules and packet flow  
- Compare public vs private access models  
- Build a foundation for cloud studies (AWS / Azure)

## Environment

This lab runs locally using VirtualBox, but is structured to reflect real cloud networking architectures.
